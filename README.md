## RGB Filters 

## 1 white_balance_algorithm.m 

This script captures 100 frames from a Full HD webcam, performs an automatic white balance on each frame, and then displays the original and balanced images in real time.

## 2 color_matrix_transformation.m

This script captures an image from a Full HD webcam, applies a custom color transformation using a color matrix, and then displays the original and transformed images. It also computes and displays the mean, standard deviation, and entropy for both images in a table format.

## 3 VideoLUTMapping.m

This script captures 100 frames from a Full HD webcam, applies a linear lookup table (LUT) transformation on each frame, and then displays the original and transformed images in real time.

## 4 RealTimeVideoFilteringAndEdgeDetection.m

This script captures frames in real-time from a Full HD webcam, converts each frame to grayscale, applies different filters: Laplacian, Sobel, Motion, and a Canny edge detection, and then displays the original grayscale and the filtered images in real time.

## 5 RealTimeVideoFilterAnalysis_GaussianNoise.m

This script captures frames in real-time from a Full HD webcam, adds Gaussian noise to the images, applies Gaussian and Median filters, and displays the original noisy, Gaussian filtered, and Median filtered images. Following that it displays the histograms and the mean and standard deviation of the video stream's grayscale values in real time. 

## 6 RealTimeVideoFilterAnalysis.m

This script captures frames in real-time from a Full HD webcam, applies Gaussian and Median filters to the images, and displays the original and filtered images. Following that it displays the histograms and the mean and standard deviation of the images' grayscale values in real time.

## 7 RealTimeHistogramEqualization.m

This script captures 100 frames from a Full HD webcam, converts each frame to grayscale, performs histogram equalization, and then displays the original and equalized images along with their histograms and cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) in real time.

## 8 Morphological_operations.m 

This script captures frames in real-time from a Full HD webcam, converts each frame to grayscale, performs different morphological operations: erosion, dilation, opening, and closing using a disk-shaped structuring element, and then displays these images along with their histograms and statistical properties (mean, standard deviation, entropy) in real time.

## 9 LinearColorMapping.m 

This script captures 100 frames from a Full HD webcam, applies a linear contrast stretching transformation on each frame which scales the intensity values to utilize the full range of the color map, and then displays the original and transformed images in real time.

## 10 LUT_Mapping_Comparison.m

This script takes a single snapshot from a Full HD webcam, applies different transformations to the image (power function, contrast enhancement, color manipulation, and sigmoid function), and then displays the original and transformed images in a 2x3 grid. It then calculates the mean, standard deviation, and entropy for each of these images. 

## 11 HistogramEqualization.m

This script takes a snapshot from the camera and converts the image to grayscale. It then applies a histogram equalization operation to the grayscale image, which can improve the contrast in an image. 

## 12 Exposure_Fusion.m 

This script captures real-time video from a camera, adjusts the brightness of each frame by applying different exposure levels, averages the adjusted frames to create a "fused" frame, and displays the original and processed frames with their respective brightness levels.

## 13 Color_balancing.m

The script continuously captures images from a camera, adjusts the red and blue channels to match the green for color balance, and displays both the original and the balanced image side by side in real time.

## 14 ColorCorrectionLUT.m

This script captures an image from a camera and applies a color correction LUT to the image by scaling the red channel by 1.2, the green channel by 0.8, and leaves the blue channel unchanged. It then displays the original image and the color corrected images.
